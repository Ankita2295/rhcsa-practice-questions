# RHCSA Practice Questions repository

This repository contains separate practice questions/scenarios that should help You pass **RHCSA** exam. It is a collection gathered from various places on the internet - below list should contain all sources I've used to create it.

* InsideGNULinux - https://insidegnulinux.blogspot.com/2016/11/rhel-7-rhcsa-exam-questions-and-answers.html
* LearnCertification - http://www.learncertification.com/study-material/practice-question-paper-with-answers


Every question is placed in separate file - therefore it is easier to split studying into small and comprehensive parts which can be used every day. At the very beginning there is a question, then comes blank space in order for the answer not be seen when opening the file. I've tried to make answers clear and very detailed - mentioning possible problems You can encounter along the way.

If You've found any mistake or error please do not hesitate to contact me or create PR with a fix. If You want to expand this repo please feel free to do so - I am open to PR all the time.
